## Hints and Notes:

- **User Profiles**: All users are stored in the `users` collection with their basic profile info, and each user document can contain their journals and a reference to their chats.
- **Chat Storage**: The `chats` collection serves as the central storage for all conversations. Each chat document has a subcollection for messages, storing the individual exchanges between users.
- **Town Functionality**: The `townsquare` collection allows users to join group conversations. Each town has its own set of members.
- **Subcollections**: Using subcollections for `messages` inside `chats` helps to keep related data (such as messages) easily accessible and avoid flat document structures that could be harder to query efficiently.

---

## Security Considerations:

- **User Journals**: Access should be restricted so that only the user who owns the journal can view or edit their entries.
- **Chat Access**: Only participants in a chat should have access to the chat and its messages.
- **Town Membership**: Only members of a town should be able to participate in conversations or see messages.
