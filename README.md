# The All In One CheetSheat

This is my knowledge...

## JavaScript

- [Configuing of absolute imports](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react/blob/master/docs/project-standards.md#absolute-imports) i.e using `@/components/my-component` instead of `../../../components/my-component`.

## React

- [`children` prop is the most basic and easiest way to optimize your components.](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react/blob/master/docs/performance.md#children-as-the-most-basic-optimization)

## React Native

- [React Native Starter Guide](https://starter.obytes.com/overview/)
- [React Native Starter Pack to create an Expo app.](http://rn.new/)
- For authentication structure, [react-navigation docs explained it well](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/auth-flow/).
- To add cursor selection position:

  - In `<TextInput />`, use `onSelectionChange` prop to get the clicked position:

    ```javascript
    selection={selectionPosition}
    onSelectionChange={(event) => event.nativeEvent.selection}
    ```
  - Then use a state to keep track, then set the cursor to the current position using the `selection` prop in `<TextInput />`
- [Use the SafeAreaView component on the screens you register with a React Navigation navigator.](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/4.x/handling-iphonex/#:~:text=use%20the%20SafeAreaView%20component%20on%20the%20screens%20you%20register%20with%20a%20React%20Navigation%20navigator.)
- [Use useSafeAreaInsets hook from react-native-safe-area-context instead of SafeAreaView component](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/handling-safe-area#summary:~:text=Use%20useSafeAreaInsets%20hook%20from%20react%2Dnative%2Dsafe%2Darea%2Dcontext%20instead%20of%20SafeAreaView%20component)
- For setting up [themes](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/themes)
- To persist in a current screen when developing, [this could come in handy](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/state-persistence).
- Use `TouchableWithoutFeedback` to wrap the entire screen to dismiss the keyboard when tapping outside the `TextInput` by calling `Keyboard.dismiss()`.

## Expo

- To delay the app's startup until resources are ready, [check here](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/splash-screen/#usage).
- In expo router, [something must be rendered to the screen](https://docs.expo.dev/router/reference/authentication/#alternative-loading-states) while [loading the initial auth state](https://docs.expo.dev/router/reference/authentication/#navigating-without-navigation).
- Instead of using fonts through assets you can opt in for getting the fonts straight from [expo-google-fonts](https://github.com/expo/google-fonts)
- To start expo app without cache, run `npx expo start --clear`
- So apparently, there's [expo secure store](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/securestore/) and [react native async storage](https://react-native-async-storage.github.io/async-storage/docs/usage/), each can both used to store values locally on the device. When to use which:

  > Use react native async storage to store non-sensitive data, such as user preferences, user preferences, app state, or caching.
  >
  > Use expo secure store to store sensitive data like passwords, tokens, or personal information
  >
- Using [Expo Secure store as the custom persistence manger for firebase auth](https://github.com/expo/fyi/blob/main/firebase-js-auth-setup.md#use-a-custom-persistence-manager) *(untested)*
- Expo vector icon supports [using the icon as a button](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/icons/#button-component). For instance:

  ```javascript
  <Ionicons.Button name={"people"} size={24} color="#ffffff">
    This is a button icon
  </Ionicons.Button>
  ```
- Expo Router automatically adds [react-native-safe-area-context support](https://docs.expo.dev/router/migrate/from-react-navigation/#:~:text=Expo%20Router%20automatically,support.).
- To preload/cache expo icons, expo google fonts or local fonts in the `useFonts` hook:

  ```javascript
  const [fontLoaded, fontError] = useFonts({
    BarlowSCRegular: require("RELATIVE_PATH_HERE"), // Load local fonts
    Inter_900Black, // Load fonts from expo-google-fonts
    ...Ionicons.font, // Load icon fonts from @expo/vector-icons
  });
  ```
- In Expo Router, keep only the initial screens in the `(tabs)` folder. Move any nested stacks outside to avoid issues with [hiding the tab bar](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/hiding-tabbar-in-screens/) and [routing between stacks in different tabs](https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/26211#issuecomment-1887857547).
- For keyboard handling, check out this thorough [guide](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/keyboard-handling/).
- To prevent bottom tabs from moving above the keyboard on Android, set `softwareKeyboardLayoutMode` to `pan` in [app config](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/keyboard-handling/#keyboard-avoiding-view:~:text=%22expo%22%20%7B%0A%20%20%22android%22%3A%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%22softwareKeyboardLayoutMode%22%3A%20%22pan%22%0A%20%20%7D%0A%7D) or [tabBarHideOnKeyboard](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/bottom-tab-navigator/#tabbarhideonkeyboard)

## Prettier

- To format code with Prettier and sort Tailwind classes:

  - _Install the packages_:

    ```javascript
    npm install -D prettier prettier-plugin-tailwindcss
    ```
  - _Create a `.prettierrc` file, then add_:

    ```javascript
    npm install -D prettier prettier-plugin-tailwindcss
    ```
  - _As a plus, to format all specific files (e.g `.js` and `.jsx` files) and reformat Tailwind classes in one go, run_:

    ```javascript
    npx prettier "**/*.{js,jsx}" --write
    ```

## [NativeWind](https://www.nativewind.dev/v4/overview/)

- ClassNames can be used in a [Flatlist component](https://www.nativewind.dev/v4/overview/#:~:text=NativeWind%20maps%20className%2D%3Estyle%2C%20but%20it%20can%20handle%20the%20mapping%20of%20complex%20components.).
- To create a component with default styles

  ```javascript
  function MyComponent({ className }) {
    const defaultStyles = "text-black dark:text-white";
    return <Text className={`${defaultStyles} ${className}`} />;
  }

  <MyComponent className="font-bold" />;
  ```
- To handle components with multiple style props:

  ```javascript
  function MyComponent({ className, textClassName }) {
    return (
      <View className={className}>
        <Text className={textClassName}>Text Component</Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
  ```
- To style a child element based on its parent's state, [mark the parent with the `group` class and apply `group-*` modifiers](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#styling-based-on-parent-state).
- [Don&#39;t use `space-{n}` anymore, instead use `gap-*`](https://www.nativewind.dev/v4/tailwind/spacing/space-between#:~:text=space%2D%7Bn%7D%20was%20temporary%20removed%20in%20v4)
- `Divide Width` has [temporarily been removed](https://www.nativewind.dev/v4/tailwind/borders/divide-width).
- Outline doesn't work in NativeWind
- Transitions and Animations are experimental features. Use with caution.

## Firebase

- In Firestore, [addDoc()](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/manage-data/add-data#add_a_document) adds a new document with an auto-generated ID. [setDoc()](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/manage-data/add-data#set_a_document) creates or replaces a document with a specific ID (pass `{ merge: true }` to avoid overwriting document). [updateDoc()](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/manage-data/add-data#update-data) updates specific fields in an existing document (and only if the document exists).
- Currently, [Firebase does not support providers authentication](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/issues/5699#issuecomment-961263804) (e.g Google) using signInWIthPopup / signInWIthRedirect f**or React Native.** Here is [another way to set it up](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/google-authentication/).
- To reduce storage costs, [exclude long string fields](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/query-data/index-overview#:~:text=Description-,Large%20string%20fields,-If%20you%20have) not used for querying (e.g., notes, comments) from indexing.
- In Firestore, [serverTimestamp()](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/manage-data/add-data#server_timestamp) is preferred to ensure all records have a consistent timestamp.
- All [Firebase Auth Error Codes](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/auth#autherrorcodes)
- In Firebase, [prefer initializeAuth() over getAuth()](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/custom-dependencies#:~:text=The%20first%2C,map%20of%20dependencies.).
- To batch upload data to Firestore Database:
  ```javascript
  async function batchUploadToFirestore(dataArray, collectionName) {
    try {
      const uploadPromises = dataArray.map(async (dataItem) => {
        const docRef = doc(collection(db, collectionName));
        await setDoc(docRef, { ...dataItem, id: docRef.id });
      });

      await Promise.all(uploadPromises);
      console.log(`All data uploaded to Firestore collection: ${collectionName}`);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(`Failed to upload data to Firestore collection: ${collectionName}`, error);
    }
  }
  /*
   * Note:
   * - This is most efficient for creating new documents with auto-generated IDs.
   * - If your dataItem already has a meaningful 'id', use:
   *   setDoc(doc(db, collectionName, dataItem.id), dataItem);
   */
  ```

## Overall

- For color theme generation, use [UI Colors](https://uicolors.app/) or [Realtime Colors](realtimecolors.com) or [Color Mind](http://colormind.io/bootstrap/) or better still ask AI (Copilot or Claude)
- For UI component libraries, use [Tamagui](https://tamagui.dev/) or [gluestack (formerly NativeBase)](https://gluestack.io/).
- For toast notification, use [react-native-toast-message](https://github.com/calintamas/react-native-toast-message),  [react-native-notifier](https://github.com/seniv/react-native-notifier), [react-native-toast](https://github.com/backpackapp-io/react-native-toast)
- In Zustand, [when combining smaller stores into a single bounded store](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand/blob/main/docs/guides/slices-pattern.md), use `create` only for the bounded store, not for each individual stores.
  > Note: When combining stores into one, make sure each store has **unique state property names**. If state properties overlap (e.g., both stores having `isLoading`), this can lead to serious side effects, as one state might overwrite the other unexpectedly.
